# Simple AutoEncoder in TensorFlow

This implementation is a TensorFlow implementation of the autoencoder for 
MNIST implemented in ConvNetJS by [Andrej 
Karpathy](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy). This was created mostly as 
a learning exercise. You can read more about why I made it 
[here](https://gertjanvandenburg.com/blog/autoencoder).
